{"name":"Libusb-compat","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.libusb.org/libusb-compat-0.1.git","body":"libusb-compat-0.1\r\n=================\r\n\r\nA compatibility layer allowing applications written for libusb-0.1 to work\r\nwith libusb-1.0. libusb-compat-0.1 attempts to look, feel, smell and walk\r\nlike libusb-0.1.\r\n\r\nDo not attempt to install libusb-0.1 and libusb-compat-0.1 on the same system.\r\n\r\nKnown quirks/differences from libusb-0.1:\r\n 1. usb_resetep(), a previously deprecated function, is implemented as\r\n    equivalent to calling usb_clear_halt().\r\n 2. libusb-0.1 allowed you to open a device which you did not have permission\r\n    to do anything useful with (all I/O requests would immediately fail).\r\n    libusb-compat-0.1 does not allow you to open such devices. You can still\r\n    read descriptor info without opening a device.\r\n 3. usb_device's \"num_children\" attribute is hardcoded to 0, and \"children\"\r\n    is hardcoded to NULL. Do you need this information in your software? Let\r\n    us know on the mailing list, and we'll add it.\r\n 4. Some libusb-0.1 users may have implemented I/O cancellation by running\r\n    transfers in their own threads and simply killing the thread when they\r\n    don't want to do the transfer any more. This is bad programming practice\r\n    for obvious reasons, and this lack of functionality was one of the primary\r\n    drivers for libusb-1.0 development. With libusb-1.0 or libusb-compat-0.1\r\n    backed by libusb-1.0, forcefully killing threads in this way is likely\r\n    to cause all libusb I/O to halt. Instead, port your application to use\r\n    libusb-1.0's asynchronous transfer API, which supports transfer\r\n    cancellation.\r\n 5. Error codes returned on certain events may not exactly match the error\r\n    codes returned by libusb-0.1. Patches accepted to bring us closer to the\r\n    behaviour of libusb-0.1 on Linux.\r\n 6. The internal structure of usb_dev_handle is different from libusb-0.1. Of\r\n    course, since this is a purely internal structure, that shouldn't cause\r\n    any problems. In reality, some libusb-0.1 users make assumptions about what\r\n    is inside (bad programming practice) and those assumptions are no longer\r\n    true, resulting in broken software.\r\n\r\nlibusb homepage:\r\nhttp://libusb.org/\r\n\r\nUse the mailing list for questions, comments, etc:\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=libusb-devel\r\n\r\n- Peter Stuge <peter@stuge.se>\r\n(use the mailing list rather than mailing developers directly)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
